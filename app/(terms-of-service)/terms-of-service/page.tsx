              Voodoo is constantly changing and improving the Services. As part
              of this continual evolution, we may make modifications or changes
              (to all or part of the Services) such as adding or removing
              features and functionalities, offering new digital content or
              Services or discontinuing old ones. We may also need to alter or
              discontinue the Services, or any part of it, in order to make
              performance or security improvements, make changes to comply with
              law, or prevent illegal activities on or abuse of our systems.
              These changes may affect all users, some users or even an
              individual user. When the Services requires or includes
              downloadable software, that software may update automatically on
              your device once a new version or feature is available, subject to
              your device settings. We’ll try to give you notice when we make a
              material change to the Services that would adversely affect you,
              but this isn’t always practical.
            </p>

              We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so this
              Agreement may need to change along with our Services. We reserve
              the right to change this Agreement at any time, but if we do, we
              will place a notice on our site located at www.voodoo.tube, send
              you an email, and/or notify you by some other means.
            </p>
            <p className="pb-2 text-[#858BA0] ">
              If you don’t agree with the new terms, you are free to reject
              them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use
              the Services. If you use the Services in any way after a change to
              this Agreement is effective, that means you agree to all of the
              changes.

            <p className="pb-2 text-[#858BA0] ">
              Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or
              modification of this Agreement will be effective unless in writing
              and signed by both you and us.

            <p className="pb-2 text-[#858BA0] ">
              From time to time Voodoo may offer rewards or incentives for
              referring others to the Services. For details of any current
              referral offers, please see our referral page. The referring user
              (“Referrer”) may refer individuals or entities who are neither
              current customers of Voodoo nor registered users of the Services
              (“Referee”). A registered user is a person or entity that already
              has an existing account with Voodoo. There is no limit to the
              number of referrals that Referrer can make, nor the cumulative
              rewards or incentives that the Referrer may receive through such
              special offer, unless otherwise indicated. Referrer will receive
              the stated reward or incentive for each Referee sent by the
              Referrer that completes the required action described in that
              specific offer (such as signing up for an account or making a
              purchase). All Referees must be first-time recipients of the
              offer, and multiple referrals to the same individual or entity
              will be disregarded. Voodoo reserves the right to modify or
              terminate any special offers at any time and to revoke from
              Referrer and Referee the special offer at Voodoo’ discretion for
              any reason or for no reason whatsoever. If Voodoo determines that
              Referrer or Referee is attempting to obtain unfair advantage or
              otherwise violate the terms or spirit of such special offer,
              Voodoo reserves the right to (a) revoke any rewards or incentives
              issued to either Referrer or Referee and/or (b) charge the
              Referrer or Referee for any rewards or incentives (1) used by
              Referrer or Referee prior to such revocation or (2) issued by
              Voodoo to any ineligible Referrer or Referee. All special offers
              are subject to any other terms, conditions and restrictions set
              forth on the Services or presented in connection with the special
              offer.

              In order to display your User Submissions on the Services, and to
              allow other users to enjoy them (where applicable), you grant us
              certain rights in those User Submissions (see below for more
              information). Please note that all of the following licenses are
              subject to our Privacy Policy to the extent they relate to User
              Submissions that are also your personally-identifiable

              sure your content is viewable on a mobile device as well as a
              computer) and reproduce and otherwise act with respect to such
              User Submissions, in each case to enable us to operate the
              Services, as described in more detail below. This is a license
              only – your ownership in User Submissions is not affected.

              Account, in a manner that is not viewable by any other user except
              you (a “Personal User Submission”), you grant Voodoo the license
              above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute
              your Personal User Submission for the sole purpose of making that
              Personal User Submission accessible to you and providing the

              specified users can view (for example, a private message to one or
              more other users) (a “Limited Audience User Submission”), then you
              grant Voodoo the licenses above, as well as a license to display,
              perform, and distribute your Limited Audience User Submission for
              the sole purpose of making that Limited Audience User Submission
              accessible to such other specified users, and providing the

              question, or disagreement arising out of or relating to the
              subject matter of this Agreement directly through good-faith
              negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party
              initiating arbitration. If such negotiations do not resolve the
              dispute, it shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in San
              Francisco County, California. The arbitration will proceed in the
              English language, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined
              Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “Rules”) then in effect, by
              one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving

              seek its attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the
